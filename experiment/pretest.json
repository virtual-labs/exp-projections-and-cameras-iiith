            "question": "1. What is the primary purpose of a camera matrix in computer graphics?",
            "answers": {
                "a": "To store pixel values of an image.",
                "b": "To define the position and orientation of the virtual camera.",
                "c": "To execute image compression algorithms.",
                "d": "To control the color balance of rendered images."
            },
            "correctAnswer": "b",
            "explanation": "The camera matrix is crucial in defining the position and orientation of the virtual camera in a 3D scene, determining how the scene is projected onto the 2D image plane.",
            "difficulty": "beginner"
        },
        {
            "question": "2. In perspective projection, what happens to the size of objects as they move farther away from the virtual camera?",
            "answers": {
                "a": "They remain the same size.",
                "b": "They shrink in size.",
                "c": "They become larger.",
                "d": "Their size becomes unpredictable."
            },
            "correctAnswer": "b",
            "explanation": "In perspective projection, objects appear smaller as they move farther away from the camera, simulating real-world visual phenomena.",
            "difficulty": "beginner"
        },
        {
            "question": "3. What is the purpose of the 'field of view' parameter in a camera?",
            "answers": {
                "a": "To control the depth of field in photography.",
                "b": "To specify the range of colors captured by the camera.",
                "c": "To determine the width of the image frame.",
                "d": "To control the extent of the scene visible to the camera."
            },
            "correctAnswer": "d",
            "explanation": "The 'field of view' parameter in a camera defines the extent of the scene that is visible to the camera, influencing the framing of the rendered image.",
            "difficulty": "intermediate"

            "question": "4. Which type of projection is often used in architectural drawings and technical illustrations due to its simplicity?",
            "answers": {
                "a": "Oblique projection",
                "b": "Orthographic projection",
                "c": "Cabinet projection",
                "d": "Axonometric projection"
            },
            "correctAnswer": "b",
            "explanation": "Orthographic projection is commonly used in architectural drawings and technical illustrations for its simplicity and accurate representation of object proportions.",
            "difficulty": "intermediate"
        },
        {
            "question": "5. What is the concept of 'clipping' in computer graphics, particularly in the context of camera frustum?",
            "answers": {
                "a": "It refers to adjusting the brightness and contrast of the rendered image.",
                "b": "It involves removing objects outside the viewable region to enhance rendering efficiency.",
                "c": "It defines the process of applying textures to 3D models.",
                "d": "It signifies the adjustment of the camera's focal length."
            },
            "correctAnswer": "b",
            "explanation": "Clipping in computer graphics involves removing objects outside the viewable region of the camera frustum, optimizing rendering efficiency.",
            "difficulty": "advanced"
