## Experiment Overview
This experiment is designed to teach orthographic and perspective projections using cameras, featuring a bunny model. The demonstration covers various projections and the setup of OpenGL cameras.

## Camera Node and Transformation
- The Camera node operates similarly to other Geometry nodes but holds a higher position in the hierarchy.
- Apply transformations to the camera by editing the transformation node, similar to other nodes.
- The camera is consistently positioned at the origin of its coordinate system, facing the -ve Z-axis.
- The camera view window displays the scene from the camera's perspective.

## Interactive Motion Display
- Apply a series of transformations to both the Bunny model and the camera.
- Use the slider to observe the motion of the camera and the bunny in the global reference frame.
- Explore how these transformations influence the effective motion of the bunny within the camera view.

## Parameter Modification
- Experiment with modifying camera parameters to observe their impact on the rendered view.
- Adjust the camera alignment by modifying the coordinate system and applying additional transformations.

## Orthographic Camera Addition
- Introduce a new orthographic camera to the scene.
- Observe and compare the distinctions between orthographic and perspective views within the experiment.

By actively engaging in these steps, participants will gain practical insights into the fundamentals of projections, OpenGL cameras, and the dynamic relationship between the camera and scene elements. This hands-on approach enhances understanding and proficiency in computer graphics concepts.
