The aim of this experiment is to explain the concepts of perspective and straight-on views by exploring how cameras work in detail. Participants will gain a comprehensive understanding of how cameras play a pivotal role in shaping perspectives and capturing scenes through both perspective and orthogonal projection techniques.
