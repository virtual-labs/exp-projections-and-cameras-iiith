The primary objectives of this experiment are twofold. Firstly, participants will delve into the nuanced realm of various projections and their matrix representations, acquiring a profound understanding of projecting a 3D point using these diverse techniques. Secondly, the experiment focuses on imparting knowledge on defining an OpenGL camera, exploring its varied parameters, and skillfully visualizing the outcomes. By the end of this experiment, participants will be adept at both the theoretical and practical aspects of projections and camera configurations in the realm of computer graphics.
