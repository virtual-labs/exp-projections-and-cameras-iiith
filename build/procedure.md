## Experiment Overview
This experiment is designed to teach orthographic and perspective projections using cameras by changing paramters. The demonstration covers various projections and the setup of OpenGL cameras.

## Parameter Modification
- Experiment with modifying camera parameters to observe their impact on the rendered view.
- Adjust the camera alignment by modifying the coordinate system and applying additional transformations.

## Orthographic and Perspective Camera Addition
- Observe and compare the distinctions between orthographic and perspective views within the experiment.

By actively engaging in these steps, participants will gain practical insights into the fundamentals of projections, OpenGL cameras, and the dynamic relationship between the camera and scene elements. This hands-on approach enhances understanding and proficiency in computer graphics concepts.
